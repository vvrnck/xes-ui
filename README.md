# xes-ui

<!-- ## About the project -->

This project belongs to my undergraduate thesis with [@galbino](https://github.com/galbino) about how XES process mining can help in archiving better management decisions. The goal is to convert tabular data to XES format.

The application was made to allow eXtensible (ðŸ˜‰) features and new formats.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Good Practices

* CSS custom classes should use 2 underscore to separate words (ex: read__me);
* The global.scss should contain only generic classes;
* Write generic functions/components that can be re-used (hooks for instance);
* API calls should be wrapped in promises under the services folder;
* TypeScript should be used as much as possible;
